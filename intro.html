                <p>For years, you've studied the Central Bank of Spain—its security, its weaknesses, and its fortune.</p>
                <p>You were an insider, trusted with secrets. Then, they framed you. They took everything.</p>
                <p>Now, you're back—not as a banker, but as a mastermind.</p>
                <p>Your crew is ready: Diego, the hacker. Elena, the strategist. Lucas, the driver. And you—the leader.</p>
                <p>The plan is flawless… until an informant betrays you. The police are onto you.</p>
                <p>Time is running out. Will this be the greatest heist in history, or your final downfall?</p>
